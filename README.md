Credit Card Customer Churn Prediction

In this project, we aim to predict credit card customers churn on a challenging dataset obtained from Kaggle. By exploring what factors will influence customers' decisions, we believe our project will help business maximize the chances that the customer will remain and enable business to know what marketing action to take for each individual customer.
